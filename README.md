# Hypertonic (OLD) - 1.0.0 < 1.4.0 Infomration
This was the Hypertonic Discord Bot source code before the Hypertonic v2 release. Hypertonic is an amazing Discord Bot that takes care of most things that you want in one bot. Our multi use functions go from Moderation, Role Management, Community Engagement, Giveaways, Custom Server Prefix, Custom Channel Logging, and more. If you have any questions or any bug reports/suggestions about the old Hypertonic Discord Bot Website feel free to reach out to me!
